\note{Alternatively, the panel structure of the data can be used to perform \textbf{fixed effects (FE)} estimation.}

\subquestion{a}{Based on theoretical considerations, would you \textbf{prefer} fixed effects or random effects estimation? Justify your answer.}

\subquestion{b}{Use a \textbf{fixed effects estimator} to examine the impact of years of education (edyears) on \textbf{log(income)}, controlling for age, gender (male), marital status categories, ethnicity categories, and childbirth. Interpret the coefficient on years of education in terms of its \textbf{sign}, \textbf{magnitude}, and \textbf{statistical significance}. Compare your results with those from the \textbf{pooled OLS} and \textbf{random effects} models.}
