\subquestion{a}{Compare the key assumptions underlying \textbf{pooled OLS}, \textbf{fixed effects (FE)}, and \textbf{random effects (RE)} estimators. Discuss theoretically in which scenarios you would prefer to use each method.}

\subquestion{b}{Within the practical context of this assignment (effect of education on earnings), provide an example situation for each estimator in the form of a \textbf{Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)}. For each case (Pooled OLS, FE, and RE), explain why the assumptions required for the respective method hold in that example, and why that method would be preferred.}
