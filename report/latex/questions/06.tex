\note{Recent research provides compelling evidence that after the birth of a first child, women's earnings decline sharply and remain persistently lower, while men's earnings remain largely unaffected.}

Control for age, gender (male), marital status categories, ethnicity categories, and years of education (edyears). Interpret the estimated coefficient for childbirth in terms of its \textbf{sign}, \textbf{magnitude}, and \textbf{statistical significance}.}
