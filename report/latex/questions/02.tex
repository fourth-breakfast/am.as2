\note{Now, we turn to formally estimating the effect of years of education on income. Use \textbf{pooled OLS} to examine the impact of years of education (edyears) on \textbf{log(income)}, controlling for age, gender (male), marital status categories, ethnicity categories, and childbirth.}

\subquestion{a}{What is the estimated return to \underbar{an additional year of education}? Interpret the coefficient on years of education in terms of its \textbf{sign}, \textbf{magnitude}, and \textbf{statistical significance}.}

\subquestion{b}{Differences in returns to schooling by gender are sometimes interpreted as potential evidence of \textbf{labor market discrimination}. Test whether the effect of years of education using the categorical variable created in Question 1 on log(income) is the \textbf{same for men and women}. Based on your results, do you find any evidence consistent with discrimination?}

\subquestion{c}{Under what conditions is the pooled OLS estimate of the effect of years of education \textbf{unbiased and efficient}? Do you believe these conditions are likely to hold in this context?}
